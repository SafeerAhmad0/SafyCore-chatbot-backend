# Fixes Applied to SafyCore Chatbot

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Groq Client "proxies" Error ✅
**Problem**: `Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'`
**Solution**:
- Updated `requirements.txt` to use `groq>=0.9.0`
- Simplified Groq client initialization

### 2. CORS Error Loading training_data.txt ✅
**Problem**: Browser blocked local file access due to CORS policy
**Solution**:
- Added `/training-data` API endpoint to serve the file
- Updated frontend to fetch from `http://localhost:8000/training-data`
- No more file system access from browser

### 3. Verbose Responses with Markdown Formatting ✅
**Problem**: Responses were too long and contained `**bold**` formatting
**Solution**:
- Changed model to `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (faster, more concise)
- Reduced `max_completion_tokens` from 8192 → 80
- Lowered `temperature` from 1.0 → 0.5
- Added regex to strip ALL markdown formatting (`**`, `*`, `__`, `_`)
- Updated system prompt with strict rules against formatting

## New Settings

### Model Configuration
```python
model = "llama-3.1-8b-instant"
temperature = 0.5
max_completion_tokens = 80
top_p = 0.9
```

### System Prompt Rules
- Plain text only, NO markdown
- 1 sentence maximum
- Direct and conversational
- No special characters for formatting

## How to Use

1. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache** or do a hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)

3. **Delete old session**:
   - In frontend, clear the session by changing the Session ID
   - OR use: `DELETE http://localhost:8000/conversation/default`

4. **Test with**: "What is SafyCore?"
   - Expected: "SafyCore Technologies offers AI Solutions, Cloud Services, and Custom Software Development."
   - No asterisks, no tables, no markdown!

## Response Examples

### Before
```

We help businesses modernize their technology stack, automate processes, and create tailored applications to drive growth and efficiency.

```

### After
```
SafyCore Technologies offers AI Solutions, Cloud Services, and Custom Software Development.
```

## If Asterisks Still Appear

The markdown stripping happens server-side. If you still see `**`, it means:

1. **Old conversation stored in memory**
   - Solution: Change session ID or restart server

2. **Browser showing old messages**
   - Solution: Clear the conversation in UI or refresh page

3. **Model still generating markdown**
   - The regex will strip it automatically
   - Conversation history will be clean

## Next Steps

- Adjust `max_completion_tokens` if responses are too short/long
- Modify system prompt in `app.py` for different tone
- Update `training_data.txt` with your actual company info
